# Every check CI runs, in one script you can also run yourself:
#
#   bash scripts/ci.sh
#
# Run it before opening a pull request and CI will not tell you anything new.
#
# WHY THE LOGIC LIVES HERE AND NOT IN .github/workflows/ci.yml
#
# Two reasons, and the second is not obvious.
#
# 1. A contributor can run it. A check that only exists inside a workflow file is a
#    check you cannot reproduce locally, so you discover it after pushing.
#
# 2. It keeps .github/workflows/ci.yml STABLE, which is what makes automated
#    publishing possible at all. This repository is a filtered mirror, published by a
#    job authenticated with a repository deploy key (see scripts/split-public-repo.sh
#    upstream). GitHub does not allow a deploy key, or an OAuth token without the
#    `workflow` scope, to create or update anything under .github/workflows/. So every
#    time a CI step changed, the publish was rejected at the FINAL push, after every
#    gate had already passed, with a raw git error that read like a mystery. With the
#    steps in this script, changing a check touches scripts/ci.sh (an ordinary file the
#    deploy key may write) and the workflow file stays untouched, so the publish goes
#    through.
#
# The consequence to remember: editing .github/workflows/ci.yml is now a rare,
# deliberate act (an action version bump, a trigger change) that needs a push from a
# credential with the `workflow` scope. Editing THIS file needs nothing special.
