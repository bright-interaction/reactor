// TestLogShipScrubsTheMessageBody covers the other half. The record message is
// free text an author formats by hand, so it carries the same URLs.
//
// The fixture key says out loud that it is synthetic, and that is load bearing.
// This file ships to a public mirror and the publish gate runs gitleaks over the
// filtered clone, so a fixture that merely looks like a live key refuses the
// publish over the product's own test data. It cost five mirrors exactly that.
// An EXAMPLE marker is skipped by the stopword list gitleaks' generic rules
// honour, which is a content check, so it survives a rename or a move in a way a
// path exclusion does not.
//
// The const NAME is load bearing for a SECOND and completely separate reason,
// and it is the one the previous version of this fixture got wrong.
// mirror-secret-preflight.sh does not look for key-shaped VALUES at all. It
// looks for the assignment SHAPE: (api_key|secret|password|bearer|private_key),
// then =, then a QUOTE, then 16+ key characters. The fixture this replaced was a
// URL, ?api_key=live_..., which has no quote after the = and so never matched
// that shape. Naming the const apiKey and quoting the value next to it built the
// shape by hand. Because the preflight runs BEFORE gitleaks in every split
// script, that did not trade one refusal for another: it moved the refusal
// EARLIER, and five products went from publishing to refusing over a fixture
// that had just been made safer.
//
// So the name must carry no credential keyword. Do not rename it back to apiKey,
// nor to secret, password, bearer or privateKey. The value is free to look like
// a key; the thing to the LEFT of the = is what the gate reads.
//
// It does not weaken the test either. scrubLogQuery keys on the PARAMETER NAME,
// ?api_key=, and never on the shape of the value, so a value that reads as
// obviously fake drives the identical code path. The proof is the ablation: take
// api_key out of scrubLogQuery and scrubLogAssign and this test goes red.
